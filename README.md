# SnapSummarize

SnapSummarize is a productivity tool designed to streamline your note-taking workflow. It automatically monitors your MacBook for new screenshots in a specified directory, extracts text from the images using OCR, and summarizes the extracted text using [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) `gemma-1b` model. The summarized text is then saved as a text file, making it easier to organize and reference your notes.

Useful when you're researching online, capturing snippets of information, or simply saving time by avoiding manual transcription.

## How It Works

1. **Set Up the Watch Directory**: Specify the folder where your screenshots are saved (e.g., `~/Desktop/screenshots`).
2. **Monitor for New Screenshots**: SnapSummarize continuously watches the directory for new files.
3. **Extract Text**: When a new screenshot is detected, the app uses OCR to extract text from the image.
4. **Summarize the Text**: The extracted text is summarized using the `gemma-1b` model. (run ollama pull if you do not have the model)
5. **Save the Summary**: The summarized text is saved as a `.txt` file in your output directory (e.g., `~/Desktop/screenshot_notes`).
